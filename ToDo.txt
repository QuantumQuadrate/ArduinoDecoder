Decoder Development To-Do List

1) Full 32-bit output (Up to 16-bit, best to leave it there unless necessary for speed)
2) Easier setup?
3) Negative counts? (This now works and I have no idea why)
4) Overflow/reset? (Unnecessary unless we need better than 32-bit)
5) Library?
6) Index channel support? (Unsure what this adds)
7) Stability checks (Necessary if we increase clock speed?)
